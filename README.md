# pierf
pierf is in the first place a packet injection tool. It builds packets and puts them directly on the network driver, bypassing the operating system. Therefore, it is not limited to the features of the OS. It is intended as a test tool for ethernet/ip devices. The source was maintained on sourceforge until release 0.195.0
